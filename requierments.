1. Project Overview
Project Title:

Distributed Job Scheduling System (Web-Based)

Project Description:

A Distributed Job Scheduling System is a web-based platform that allows clients to submit jobs (tasks) to a central server, which schedules, queues, and assigns jobs to available workers or executes them based on priority.
The system separates:

Client Side:
Users submit jobs, track progress, and view results.

Server Side:
Receives jobs, stores them in the database, schedules/executing them (or simulating execution), updates job status, and returns results to clients.

Purpose of the System

To enable remote job submission and management in a distributed manner, ensuring efficient job scheduling, execution, and monitoring.

Core Features

Job submission form

Job queue management

Priority-based scheduling

Job execution simulation

Distributed architecture (client & server on different computers)

Job tracking and status updates

Admin monitoring dashboard

2. Requirements
A. Functional Requirements
User (Client Side):

Users must be able to create an account and log in.

Users can submit jobs with parameters (title, description, priority, type).

The system must send submitted jobs to the server over HTTP.

Users must be able to view job history.

Users must be able to view job status updates:

Pending

Running

Completed

Failed

Server Side:

The server must receive job requests from clients.

The server must store job data in the database.

The server must schedule jobs based on:

Priority

Timestamp (FIFO or priority queue)

The server must execute or simulate executing jobs.

The server must update job status in the database.

The server must send job results back to the client view.

Admin (Server Dashboard):

Admin can view all jobs in the queue.

Admin can manually change job status.

Admin can monitor system load and active jobs.

B. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance

Must support at least 20 concurrent clients.

Server must process requests within 2 seconds.

Scalability

Should allow multiple clients to connect simultaneously.

Database should handle up to 10,000 job entries.

Security

All login and sensitive communication must use secure sessions.

Passwords must be hashed.

Usability

Interface must be simple, responsive, and mobile-friendly.

Reliability

Database must ensure no loss of job data.

Server must recover after restart and restore queue state.

Maintainability

Code must be modular and separated by layers:

Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)

Backend logic (PHP)

Database (MySQL or MariaDB)

3. System Design & Architecture

Since client and server run on different computers, communication happens through:

.HTTP/HTTPS Requests
.REST-style PHP endpoints
.Database on the server machine

High-Level Architecture
Client Machine (Computer A)

Frontend UI (HTML, CSS, JS)

Sends job requests to server API

Displays feedback returned by the server

Periodically checks job status using AJAX

Server Machine (Computer B)

Receives job requests via PHP backend

Stores jobs in MySQL database

Scheduler module selects next job

Executor module runs job or simulates processing

Sends updates back to clients
